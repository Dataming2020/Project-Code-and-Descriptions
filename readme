Project title: Assessing the Probability of the SoccerMatch Outcome

Team Members:Zhao Xinyuan, Yu Shangqing, Arman Aydemir

Description of the Project:

This project is built on Dixon and Coles model. A model which can make soccer match prediction and quantify the probability result is produced. The goal of this project is to investigate the correlation between a soccer teams history and the probability distribution for each possible match outcome in a given soccer match. The examination of the soccer result and odds data is to lead to the establishment of a model assessing the probability of each possible match outcome in a soccer match. The model will only use historical data match result data, and has no other prior information on the match.


Summary of the questions sought and answers:
1.Is soccer match result determined by strength or luck?
2.How to compare soccer team strength relative to each other? How to quantify them?
3.How are teams' strength changing during a season?
3.How to give prediction on future match results?

The answer:
Strength of a teamwhether its attack or defence relatively stay constant during a season.
Soccer games result arenot total random, ultimately team with better skills will have more chance to win the game.
A model can be built to quantify the attack and defence strength and make prediction using historical match data.
